                                Personal AI Communication Assistant

The Personal AI Communication Assistant was developed to help professionals manage multiple communication platforms, including Gmail, Slack, WhatsApp, and Telegram. The assistant streamlines communication workflows, enabling users to prioritize, summarize, and respond efficiently across these platforms. The application was built using Next.js (frontend) and Flask (backend).

1. Smart Email Management (Gmail)
Prioritize Incoming Emails: Utilized BERT to categorize emails into Urgent, Follow-up, and Low Priority based on content, helping users quickly identify important emails.
Summarize Long Email Threads: Implemented BART to generate concise summaries of lengthy email threads, allowing users to grasp key details without reading full conversations.
Suggest Quick Responses: Employed Hugging Face Distil-GPT to provide context-aware reply suggestions, enabling users to respond promptly.
Track & Remind: Integrated a reminder system to flag important unanswered emails, ensuring critical communications are not overlooked.
2. Team Communication Optimization (Slack)
Summarize Key Conversations: Used BART to extract important updates from multiple channels, providing users with a clear overview of relevant discussions.
Generate Daily Digests: Implemented a daily summary of key discussions using BERT, keeping teams informed on ongoing projects and decisions.
Convert Messages to Tasks: Applied SVM to identify actionable messages and suggest task creation, streamlining productivity.
Smart Search & Retrieval: Utilized TF-IDF and BM25 for quick lookup of past messages, enabling users to efficiently find relevant information.
3. WhatsApp Assistant for Personal & Business Chats
Automate Routine Responses: Leveraged Gemini to generate smart replies to frequently asked questions, improving response efficiency.
Summarize Long Chats: Used BART to provide quick overviews of lengthy conversations, allowing users to easily catch up on important discussions.
Set Up Follow-ups & Reminders: Integrated a reminder system for pending messages, helping users manage communication effectively.
Handle Basic Customer Service Queries: Employed Na√Øve Bayes to classify and respond to common customer inquiries, enhancing customer service efficiency.
4. Telegram Integration
Automate Routine Responses: Utilized Hugging Face models to generate smart replies in Telegram chats, improving engagement and response efficiency.
Summarize Long Conversations: Implemented BART for quick overviews of discussions, ensuring users stay informed without sifting through long chat histories.
Prioritize Messages: Categorized messages into High, Medium, and Low priority, allowing users to manage communications effectively.
Findings
Understanding App Passwords: Learned the importance of using app passwords for secure Gmail access when integrating with third-party applications.
Model Selection: Found that different ML models (BERT, BART, SVM) have unique strengths, with BART being particularly effective for summarization tasks.
Cross-Platform Integration: Discovered that seamless integration across multiple platforms (Gmail, Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram) enhances user experience and improves communication efficiency.
