Personal AI Communication Assistant
The Personal AI Communication Assistant was developed to help professionals manage multiple communication platforms, including Gmail, Slack, WhatsApp, and Telegram. The assistant is designed to streamline communication workflows, enabling users to prioritize, summarize, and respond efficiently across these platforms. The application was built using Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend.
1. Smart Email Management (Gmail)
● PrioritizeIncomingEmails:UtilizedBERTforcategorizingemailsinto Urgent, Follow-up, and Low Priority based on content. This feature helps users quickly identify which emails require immediate attention.
● SummarizeLongEmailThreads:ImplementedBARTtogenerate concise summaries of lengthy email threads, allowing users to grasp essential information without reading through extensive conversations.
● SuggestQuickResponses:EmployedHuggingFaceDistil-GPTfor context-aware reply suggestions, enabling users to respond promptly and appropriately to emails.
● Track&Remind:Integratedaremindersystemtoflagimportant unanswered emails, ensuring that critical communications are not overlooked.
2. Team Communication Optimization (Slack)
 ● SummarizeKeyConversations:UsedBARTtoextractimportant updates from multiple channels, providing users with a clear overview of relevant discussions.
● GenerateDailyDigests:Implementedadailysummaryofkey discussions using BERT, helping teams stay informed about ongoing projects and decisions.
● ConvertMessagestoTasks:AppliedSVMtoidentifyactionable messages and suggest task creation, enhancing productivity by streamlining task management.
● SmartSearch&Retrieval:UtilizedTF-IDFandBM25forefficient lookup of past messages, allowing users to quickly find relevant information.
3. WhatsApp Assistant for Personal & Business Chats
● AutomateRoutineResponses:LeveragedGeminiforgenerating smart replies to common queries, improving response times for frequently asked questions.
● SummarizeLongChats:UsedBARTtoprovidequickoverviewsof lengthy conversations, ensuring users can easily catch up on important discussions.
● SetUpFollow-ups&Reminders:Integratedaremindersystemfor pending messages, helping users manage their communications effectively.
● HandleBasicCustomerServiceQueries:EmployedNaiveBayesfor classifying and responding to common questions, enhancing customer service efficiency.
